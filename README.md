Eiko
=====
Tangible two-player card game for iPad, developped in AS3 and Starling. DIY tangible cards.
The [website](http://lecube.gobelins.fr/2014/g5/) has been developped with AngularJS and greensock's TimelineMax and TweenMax.

##Context
Eiko is an answer to a brief by [Le Cube](http://lecube.com), asking us to design an iPad application aiming to embrace the intergenerational links. We chose to focus on memories.

##Concept
Eiko is a two-player game, based on the War card game, but with tangible cards. Each player chose his generation among 3 (50's, 70's, 90's) according to his tastes and memories: each card represents a specific item from this generation, such as Gameboy, Marbles, Citroen DS or Rotary phone. If there is war (both cards are equals), a battle takes place. Theses battles are mini-games based on the items usage: you will have to rewind a tape or solve a bilboquet, for instance. At each of the five turns, they have to put a higher card than the opponent. But they can use (wisely) 2 bonuses, the first one increasing the current card's value by 2, and the second one forcing a battle, ignoring the cards values.

##Public exposure
Eiko was shown during the [Futur en Seine](http://www.futur-en-seine.fr/fens2013/) festival in Paris, at Le Cube, an exposition center. Mostly family, from 5 to 60, came to see the differents projects and play a few game. The feedback were great, mostly from the kids.
